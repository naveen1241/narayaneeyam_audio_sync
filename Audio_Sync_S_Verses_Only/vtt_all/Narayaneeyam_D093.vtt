बन्धु-स्नेहं विजह्यां
to (my) relatives affection (I will) give up
तव हि करुणया

व्यासेध: वा कथं तौ
and don'ts, how come they both
त्वयि निहित-मते:-

s4
00:00:43.833 --> 00:01:21.666 align:start
Thy grace alone will enable me to abandon my love and affection towards my relatives. With my mind merged in Thee, renouncing everything, I will wander about looking upon the whole world as an expression of Maayaa. The injunctions and prohibitions of the scriptures apply to the one who entertains the concepts of good or bad due to multiplicity caused by false comprehension. How can both of these apply to a person whose mind is absorbed in Thee and who has transcended the consciousness of differences.

---------
There are countless beings who are always absorbed in satisfying their hunger and thirst. Among them, a man is superior for being endowed with a discriminative mind. Human birth indeed is rare. Among men also a person may be one's own friend or a foe. A person whose mind is absorbed in Thee, is always  concerned in the means of alleviating sorrow, is ones own friend. All others are their own foes.

s10
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:44.333 align:start
O Lord of the Universe! When Thy grace operates there is nothing in this worldly existence which may not become a spiritual teacher. I will learn the lesson of true forbearance from the earth who does not move in spite of being oppressed by all. The air is always in contact with various objects but is not tainted by them so I will learn nonattachment from the air. The nature of my soul which is all pervasive and unaffected, will be clear to me from the sky as a teacher.

May I be clean pure and sweet like the water. May I be not blemished by taking food of any type, just as fire though all consuming, is unaffected by the defects of any substance. Just as there is fire in every tree, let me recognize me in all beings. The growth and decay is of the body, like waxing and waning of the moon, and not of Aatman, the self. By Thy grace, may I realise, the oneness of all individual bodies, just like the reflected images of the sun in universal waters.

Let me not fall a prey to the lust of women like a moth to fire. O Lord! let me seek the essence of things like the honey bee and unlike it let me not perish in accumulating wealth.

Let me not be led to captivity by women as an elephant is by a female. Let me not earn wealth in plenty because it is taken away by others, like the honey gatherers.

O Lord! May I not be killed by others like the Kurara bird for having to guard the meat it was carrying.

The spider is a teacher in the sense, that, I learnt from it that the Universe created by Thee, is absorbed into Thee, by Thee alone. From the beetle I got the firm lesson that meditating on Thee confers Thy form. On careful thought I realised that though this body is a storehouse of filth and ashes, it is a great teacher, specially this body of mine. Because of it suffering from many diseases, I have been endowed with discrimination and renunciation.
